# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `list_folders` rows now expose `folder_class`, the raw EWS
  FolderClass string (`IPF.Note`, `IPF.Appointment`, `IPF.Contact`,
  …), on both the cache and live lanes; omitted when Exchange
  reports none. Existing local mirrors gain the `folders.folder_class`
  column on open and fill it on the next hierarchy sync.

### Documentation
- Repository-wide revamp: the root README is now a single front door
  (version guide, stdio-first quick start); `docs/README.md` maps all
  documentation; the ten 4.0-era documents moved to `docs/legacy/` with
  banners; `v5/docs/API.md` gained a generated per-tool parameter
  reference (`dump_tool_table.py` now emits and drift-checks it).

### Removed
- Legacy helper scripts (`run.sh`, `scripts/build.sh`,
  `scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/setup.sh`,
  `scripts/setup-basic-auth.sh`) and redundant configuration examples
  (`.env.basic.example`, `.env.oauth2.example`, `.env.ai.example`).
  One template per line remains: root `.env.example` (4.0) and
  `v5/.env.example` (4.5).

## [4.5.0a1] - 2026-07-11 (pre-release; the `v5/` tree)

The greenfield server (`v5/ewsmcp`, package `ews-mcp` 4.5.0a1) reaches
alpha: consolidated 28-tool surface, alias-only ids, token-lean DTOs, and
a cache-first local mirror. Ships side-by-side with v3 — nothing in
`src/` changes. Full reference: `v5/docs/API.md`; architecture:
`v5/DESIGN.md`.

### Fixed (v5 pre-release criticals)
- `get_thread` passed a string `conversation_id` to `filter()` —
  exchangelib 5.0.3 requires the `ConversationId` object (the tool was
  100% broken; the old unit test pinned the broken behavior).
- Recipient allow/denylists were dead code: they now fire on every tool
  whose arguments carry recipients AND on the draft's resolved
  recipients inside `send_draft`.
- `send_draft` confirmation is content-bound (ported from v3.5): the
  token hashes subject + sorted recipients + full body and phase 2
  refetches and re-verifies — editing a draft between preview and
  confirm invalidates the token. Tokens are single-use.
- The connection probe read a cached property and reported warm forever;
  it now performs a real round trip every time, and `reset()` evicts
  exchangelib's protocol cache so auth genuinely renegotiates.

### Added
- Cache-first mirror: background EWS delta-sync into per-mailbox SQLite
  (WAL, single-writer, FTS5), cleaned bodies stored once, provenance
  stamps (`source`/`as_of`) and a `fresh` escape hatch on every read.
- Arabic-correct search: one normalization for index and query
  (diacritics, tatweel, alef/hamza/teh-marbuta/alef-maqsura folds,
  Arabic-Indic digits) — gated by a mandatory test suite.
- New tools: `get_contact`, `list_tasks`, `update_task`, `waiting_on`
  (sent threads with no reply), and `find_similar` when the optional
  pgvector/Ollama semantic tier is enabled (`EWS_SEMANTIC_INDEX`).
- Prometheus `/metrics`; audit-chain persistence across restarts + a
  verifier script; per-sender learned-signature stripping; REST-shim
  schema validation, body cap and disconnect handling.
- Structural guards: exchangelib signature/behavior pins, lazy-import
  sentinel, envelope contract, north-star budget test (≤2 calls / <2k
  tokens for "last email from X → reply as draft").

### Performance
- `QuerySet.count()` eliminated from every list path (lookahead
  pagination; exact totals only where cheap); field projections on all
  bulk fetches; server-side calendar expansion caps; alias mints batched
  off the event loop; audit writes off the event loop.

### Removed / changed (vs the 67-tool v3 surface)
- Draft-first only: no one-shot send tools. Impersonation, OAuth2,
  folder/contact management, MIME export and the server-side
  agent-secretary stack are intentionally dropped (see `v5/docs/API.md`
  for the full rename map and rationale).
- `update_messages.set_flag` removed from the schema (the backend has no
  first-class flag field; categories are the marker).
- `search_messages.from_` deprecated in favor of `sender`.

## v4.0.1 — 2026-05-03

### `?api_key=` query-param auth — Claude Desktop UI compatibility

The Claude Desktop "Custom Connector" dialog exposes a URL field and OAuth
fields (Client ID + Secret), but **no field for a static `Authorization:
Bearer` header**. Until v4.0.0 the only way to use the v4 server from
Claude Desktop was via `mcp-remote` (a CLI adapter) plus a hand-edited
`claude_desktop_config.json` — needlessly clunky for a local install.

`_authorized_request()` now accepts the same key over **three** transports:

1. `Authorization: Bearer <key>`  (preferred — RFC-6750)
2. `X-API-Key: <key>`             (legacy header)
3. `?api_key=<key>` query param   (NEW — Claude Desktop UI fallback)

The query param is only consulted as a last resort and is constant-time
compared via `hmac.compare_digest`, identical to the header path. A new
helper `redact_url_query_secrets()` masks any `api_key` / `token` /
`secret` value before a URL is written to a log line — currently no log
path includes URLs, but the helper exists as a guardrail for future work.

**To use it**: set `MCP_API_KEY=<your-token>` in the container's `.env`
(unchanged), then in Claude Desktop's Custom Connector dialog paste:

```
http://<host>:8000/sse?api_key=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Leave the OAuth Client ID / Secret fields blank. No JSON, no adapter.

This is a v4.x stop-gap. Proper OAuth 2.0 with PKCE will land in v4.1.0;
the query-param transport will remain for backward compatibility.

Verified locally against malformed input, URL-encoded values, and the
redaction helper before deploy. The repo intentionally ships without a
test directory (per the v4 cleanup); the dev kit is private.

### `&gt;` no longer renders literally on recipient side

**Bug**: when the user (or skill) called `reply_email` / `forward_email` /
`create_reply_draft` / `create_forward_draft` with `body_format="html"` and
a body that contained pre-encoded HTML entities but no tags
(e.g. `"Stage 1 &gt; Stage 2"`, `"Approved &rarr; next stage"`, `"&copy; 2026"`),
the recipient saw the entity rendered **as literal text** — `&gt;` instead of `>`.

**Cause**: `utils.format_body_for_html()` decided "is this HTML?" by looking
only for opening/closing tags. An entity-only body slipped past the
heuristic, was treated as plain text, and ran through `escape_html()` —
which escaped the leading `&` to `&amp;`, turning `&gt;` into `&amp;gt;`.
HTML mail clients then rendered that as the literal four-character string `&gt;`.

This is a sibling of the v3.4 thread-header `&amp;` cascade fix — same shape
(double-escape), different surface (body content rather than the From/To
header strip).

**Fix**: `format_body_for_html()` now also detects valid HTML entities
(`&amp;` / `&gt;` / `&#960;` / `&#x2014;`). Any body containing one is
treated as HTML and routed to `sanitize_html()` rather than `escape_html()`.

**Plus**: `create_reply_draft` and `create_forward_draft` were silently
ignoring the `body_format` parameter — they had no schema for it and
never called `compose_body`. Markdown bodies were getting plain-text
escaped, so headings/lists/code blocks didn't render. They now mirror the
send-tool path: schema includes `body_format`, and `compose_body()` runs
when it is `markdown` / `text`.

Verified locally against the full set of entity types (`&gt;` / `&amp;` /
`&#960;` / `&#x2014;` / `&copy;`), the plain-text-with-`<` no-regression
case, and the full-pipeline reproduction before deploy.

## v4.0.0 — 2026-05-03

The first **bidirectional body format** release. The MCP now accepts
markdown from the LLM on the write path and emits markdown to the LLM on
the read path — Outlook keeps getting and sending HTML on its side.
Token cost on a typical Outlook MSO body drops ~12× compared with the
v3.4 `body_html` default.

This release also draws the **MCP / skill boundary** more clearly: the
MCP does deterministic data work (fetching, transforming, embedding,
extracting, persisting). The consuming skill / agent does the reasoning
(classification, summarisation, generation, decision-making). Five LLM-
proxying tools have been removed because the skill already has an LLM
loaded and can do that work in the same conversation, without a second
round trip and without the MCP needing an `AI_MODEL` configuration for
those features.

### Added

- **`format=html|markdown|text` on `get_email_details`** (default `html`,
  no breaking change). `markdown` runs the Outlook MSO body through
  `markdownify` server-side with an MSO-aware strip list, caches the
  result in SQLite forever (Exchange messages are immutable post-send),
  and returns ~12× fewer tokens for the same semantic content. When
  `format!="html"`, the heavy `body_html` field is also dropped from
  the response so the headline byte saving is real, not theoretical.
  Companion booleans:
  - `trim_quoted=true` strips `On …, X wrote:` history out of the body.
  - `include_body=false` drops both `body` and `body_html` for
    list-style calls where the agent only wants the envelope.
- **`format=` schema on `read_emails`** (acknowledged but no
  functional change in v4.0 — `read_emails` returns only short
  previews so the conversion has nothing to convert; the schema is
  in place so v4.1 can extend the rendering uniformly across the
  list-style tools without further breaking changes).
- **`body_format=html|markdown|text` on `send_email` / `reply_email` /
  `forward_email`** (default `html`, no breaking change). When set to
  `markdown`, the LLM-supplied body is converted to HTML via Python-
  Markdown before being handed to EWS. The signature-preservation path
  on `reply_email` / `forward_email` is unchanged — Outlook's signature
  with its inline cid: image refs still appears at the bottom of the
  rendered email. Acceptance criterion verified live:
  `inline_attachments_preserved: 3` on a markdown reply.
- **Unified per-mailbox SQLite cache** at
  `data/ews_mcp_<mailbox>.sqlite`. Single file, three tables:
  `body_format_cache`, `attachment_text_cache`, `embedding_cache`.
  No vector-database dependency required.
- **One-shot legacy migration**: on first startup, if a v3.4
  `data/embeddings/embeddings.json` is present, it is read once,
  imported into the new `embedding_cache` table (typically against
  `nomic-embed-text` model). Idempotent. The legacy file is left in
  place so the existing JSON-based EmbeddingService continues to
  work; SQLite is wired in at the same time as a parallel cache, and
  becomes authoritative once the read path is rewired (also in v4.0).

- **Expanded `read_attachment` text extraction**:
  - `pptx` — slide-by-slide via `python-pptx`, including speaker notes and embedded tables
  - `msg` — Outlook compound-file via `extract-msg`. Returns subject/from/to/cc/date envelope, body (HTML→markdown if present), and a recursive nested-attachment listing. Solves the very common "user forwarded an entire thread as a .msg attachment" workflow.
  - `eml` — RFC-822 via stdlib `email`. Same shape as `.msg`.
  - `html` / `htm` — markdownify, RTL-safe (Arabic / Hebrew preserved)
  - `csv`, `log`, `json`, `xml`, `md` — BOM-aware UTF-8/UTF-16 decode
  - The pre-v4 PDF / DOCX / XLSX / TXT paths are unchanged.

- **Issue #112 — Exchange ID handling**. `is_exchange_folder_id()` recognises both `AAMk` and `AQMk` prefixes. `move_email` and `copy_email` resolve `destination_folder_id` directly via `find_folder_by_id` instead of the path/name resolver. `copy_email` no longer returns empty `copied_message_id` when exchangelib hands back a bare `ItemId`.

- **Issue #114 — Outlook categories on 9 create/update tools**. New optional `categories: list[str]` parameter on `create_appointment`, `update_appointment`, `create_task`, `update_task`, `create_contact`, `update_contact`, `create_draft`, `create_reply_draft`, `create_forward_draft`. Replace-on-update semantics; empty list clears. (`update_email` already supported it in v3.4.)

- **Issue #115 — `is_flagged` filter on `search_emails`**. New boolean filter mapping to `PR_FLAG_STATUS` extended property. Wired into both quick and full-text search modes.

- **Issue #119 — `cc` / `bcc` on `create_reply_draft`**. Caller-supplied recipients now persist on the saved draft (was silently dropped). Deduplicated against auto-derived `to_recipients`. Surfaced on the response.

- **Issue #121 — `oof_settings` set-path correctness**. Existing replies are preserved when caller omits them (was overwriting with default text). Scheduled `start`/`end` are normalised to UTC before EWS (fixes `InvalidScheduledOofDuration` on PBS Exchange). `currently_active` is returned by the set path too.

### Removed

- `classify_email`, `summarize_email`, `suggest_replies` — pure LLM
  reasoning that the consuming skill should do natively. See README
  migration table for replacements.
- `extract_commitments` — LLM extraction; skill detects + calls
  `track_commitment` (manual CRUD remains).
- `build_voice_profile` — LLM analysis; skill analyses + persists via
  the memory KV (`get_voice_profile` remains for read-back).

### Changed

- **`AI_MODEL` is now optional**. The only remaining MCP-side LLM call
  is the embedding model for `semantic_search_emails`, which uses
  `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. With the 5 reasoning tools removed, no chat
  model is required.
- **Tool count: 70 → 67**. Tool surface listed in the README.

### Engineering

- New module `src/body_format.py` — `render_body` (HTML→markdown),
  `compose_body` (markdown→HTML), `trim_quoted`, plus the schema
  fragments `READ_FORMAT_SCHEMA` / `WRITE_FORMAT_SCHEMA` so the new
  parameters declare uniformly across every tool that uses them.
- New module `src/cache/sqlite_cache.py` — `SQLiteCache` wrapper with
  WAL journaling, packed `float32` embedding storage, and the legacy
  JSON importer.
- `EmbeddingService` rewired to consult SQLite before the network. Lookup order: in-memory dict → SQLite (bulk fetch via `get_embeddings_bulk`) → embed provider. JSON write-path is bypassed when SQLite is wired.
- ~1100 lines of unreachable code dropped: the 5 LLM-reasoning tool class bodies (`ClassifyEmailTool`, `SummarizeEmailTool`, `SuggestRepliesTool`, `ExtractCommitmentsTool`, `BuildVoiceProfileTool`).
- Reply / forward path: when `body_format != "html"`, skip the second `format_body_for_html`/`sanitize_html` pass — `compose_body` already produced trusted HTML and the regex-based sanitiser can mangle markdown code fences.
- Two new dependencies: `markdownify>=0.13.1` (HTML→Markdown), `markdown>=3.5` (Markdown→HTML), `extract-msg>=0.50.0` (Outlook .msg compound-file reader).
- Per-repo git identity is set to `noreply@anthropic.com` to keep
  contributor email addresses out of public commit history.
- The `data_dir` (default `data`) is read off the `Settings` object
  via `getattr` so older configs without the field continue to work.

## v3.4 — Test-suite hardening + 3 production bugs

A focused pass to break the "fix one bug, the next refactor regresses
another" cycle. The shipped tests now pin the structural patterns that
caused the recurring regressions, and three live bugs that the existing
suite did not flag are fixed.

### Production bugs fixed

- **`evaluate_rules_on_message` `move_to_folder` action was silently
  broken.** Three defects in three lines of `_apply_actions`:
  the lazy `from .folder_tools import resolve_folder_for_account`
  pointed at the wrong module (`resolve_folder_for_account` lives in
  `email_tools.py`); the call was missing `await` on a coroutine;
  the kwarg name was `folder_name=` instead of the actual
  `folder_identifier=`. All three were masked by the per-action
  `try/except Exception` that turns failures into a logged
  `"error"` field, so the rule engine reported `"ok"` overall while
  no message was actually moved. Resolver is now imported at module
  top, awaited, and called with the correct positional argument.

- **Audit log silently leaked hyphenated header values.**
  `redact_sensitive` matched on substring against the `_SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERNS`
  list (`password`, `token`, `secret`, `api_key`, ...). Header-style
  spellings like `X-API-Key`, `Auth-Token`, and `Client-Secret` slipped
  past because the matcher compared `x-api-key` against `api_key`
  (no substring hit). The matcher now normalises hyphens to
  underscores before comparison, so both `api_key` and `X-API-Key`
  redact identically.

- **`format_body_for_html` misclassified plain text as HTML.**
  The "looks like HTML" heuristic was `<[^>]+>`, which matched any
  content containing a `<` — including plain text like `"if a < b"`.
  Such inputs were routed through `sanitize_html` (which preserves
  the `<`), so stray `<` ended up in rendered email as raw markup.
  The heuristic now requires a real opening or closing tag pattern
  (`</?[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*\b[^<>]*/?>`), so plain text with
  comparison operators is escaped correctly.

### Structural test additions

- **`tests/test_exchangelib_signatures.py`** — 19 contract tests
  pinning every `exchangelib` API the codebase calls with kwargs
  (`Item.delete`, `Item.save`, `Message.send`, `Account.fetch`,
  `CalendarItem.save`, `OofSettings`, `FileAttachment`, indexed
  properties imports). The `OofReply`/`disposal_type` outage class
  now fails locally before code can ship — the tests run against
  the real `inspect.signature` of the installed `exchangelib`.

- **`tests/test_no_lazy_exchangelib_imports.py`** — AST-based
  sentinel that fails if any `from exchangelib...` appears inside
  a function body in `src/`, and a sibling check for lazy
  intra-`src/tools/` imports. Module-top guarded `try/except`
  imports remain allowed (they fail loud at import). 14 lazy
  imports across `oof_tools.py`, `attachment_tools.py`,
  `calendar_tools.py`, `email_tools.py`, `briefing_tools.py`,
  `oof_policy_tools.py`, `meeting_prep_tools.py`,
  `gal_adapter.py`, and `utils.py` were hoisted as part of
  this change.

- **`tests/test_rule_actions_execute_path.py`** — 7 execute-path
  tests for `_apply_actions` covering every action type
  (`move_to_folder`, `flag_importance`, `categorize`, `mark_read`,
  unknown). The `move_to_folder` test uses an `AsyncMock` resolver
  + a typed message stub that rejects coroutines and unknown kwargs
  — the bug fixed above would have failed all three of its
  assertions.

- **`tests/test_format_body_for_html.py`** — 14 tests pinning the
  `<` heuristic, the cascading-escape contract, the
  `sanitize_html` script/style/handler/javascript-uri removal,
  and the explicit one-shot-vs-idempotent semantics.

- **`tests/test_audit_redaction.py`** — 31 parametrized tests
  covering every entry in `_SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERNS`, the substring
  variants (`client_secret`, `access_token`), header-style
  spellings (`X-API-Key`), nested dicts, lists of dicts, long-string
  truncation, and the inventory pin (the explicit list of patterns
  is asserted whole so subtractions or typos surface immediately).

- **`tests/test_read_attachment.py`** — 9 tests for
  `ReadAttachmentTool` (CHANGELOG C1) — the tool had no
  execute-path coverage despite its extractor methods having
  previously been on the wrong sibling class. Tests pin the dispatch
  to `_read_pdf` / `_read_docx` / `_read_excel`, the .txt happy
  path, and every error path (missing attachment, empty content,
  unsupported extension).

- **`tests/test_add_attachment_passes_content_id.py`** — 2 tests
  patching `FileAttachment` and inspecting actual constructor
  kwargs, so a future refactor that records `content_id` in the
  response dict but drops it from the constructor call (silently
  breaking inline images) would fail.

### Documentation

- New `docs/COMMON_PITFALLS.md` summarises the seven recurring
  patterns and their guard tests.

### Operator-visible changes

None. All changes are additive (tests, hoisted imports) or pure
bug fixes that restore documented behaviour. No tool schema or
response shape changed.

## Unreleased — AI / semantic_search reachable from Docker bridge networks

**Bug**: every `semantic_search_emails` call against the production NAS
returned `ToolExecutionError: Embedding provider error: Embedding endpoint
unreachable at http://&lt;HOST_LAN_IP&gt;:11434/v1/embeddings: ConnectError: All
connection attempts failed`. The hint pointed at `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, which
sent the operator on a wrong-trail debug — Ollama was healthy and the model
was correct.

**Cause**: two issues stacked.
1. *Networking*: the production container runs on a Docker bridge network
   (`mcp-network`). From inside the bridge, the host's LAN IP
   (`&lt;HOST_LAN_IP&gt;`) is NOT routable — bridge containers can only reach the
   host via the bridge gateway. `AI_BASE_URL=http://&lt;HOST_LAN_IP&gt;:11434/v1`
   silently failed at TCP-connect time.
2. *Diagnostic*: `_embedding_error_hint` always returned the same model-name
   hint regardless of whether the underlying error was an HTTP 404 (wrong
   model) or a `ConnectError` (unreachable host).

**Fix**:
- `docker-compose-ghcr.yml` now attaches ews-mcp to a shared external
  bridge `claude-shared` alongside its private `mcp-network`. Sibling
  containers (Ollama, Postgres/pgvector, future shared services)
  attached to the same network resolve each other by container name
  via Docker DNS — no host-port hop, no hard-coded LAN IPs, and each
  app keeps its own compose file. A `host.docker.internal` fallback is
  documented for single-stack deployments that don't want a shared net.
- Updated `.env.ai.example` with five concrete `AI_BASE_URL` choices
  ranked by topology (shared external net → bridge fallback →
  host-network → bare-metal → LAN). Strong warning against using the
  host's LAN IP from inside a bridge.
- Refactored the hint dispatcher into `_embedding_error_hint(exc_msg)` —
  branches on the underlying error and returns a *networking* hint that
  surfaces both the recommended `claude-shared` path and the
  `host.docker.internal` fallback when the error is connect-style.
  Otherwise returns the *model-name* hint. New regression test
  `tests/test_ai_embedding_hint.py` pins the dispatch.

**Operator action**: one-time `docker network create claude-shared` on
the host, then attach the Ollama compose to the same external network
(name the container `ollama` or set a network alias), re-pull ews-mcp
with the new compose, and set `AI_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434/v1`.

## Unreleased — `delete_email(permanent=True)` no longer 500s

**Bug**: every `delete_email` / `manage_email` call with `permanent=True` (or
`hard_delete=True`) returned `500 ToolExecutionError: Failed to delete email:
TypeError: Item.delete() got an unexpected keyword argument 'disposal_type'`
on the live NAS. Soft-delete (move-to-trash) was unaffected.

**Cause**: the source called `item.delete(disposal_type=HARD_DELETE)` with a
fallback to `item.delete(disposal_type="HardDelete")`. Neither kwarg exists
on `exchangelib.items.Item.delete()` in 5.x — its signature is
`delete(send_meeting_cancellations, affected_task_occurrences, suppress_read_receipts)`
and it already invokes `_delete(delete_type=HARD_DELETE)` internally. The
unit tests passed because `MagicMock().delete(disposal_type=...)` silently
records any kwarg, so the divergence between the mock and the real signature
was never caught.

**Fix**: call the bare `item.delete()` — already a HARD_DELETE in 5.x.
Added a guard test that pins `inspect.signature(Item.delete).parameters` so
we'd notice if the API ever grows that kwarg back. Surfaced during a live
NAS smoke test of the reply/forward double-escape fix.

## Unreleased — Reply/forward thread no longer accumulates `&amp;` entities

**Bug**: long email threads would show cascading ampersands between contact
names — `John Smith &amp;lt;john@x.com&amp;gt;` after one reply,
`&amp;amp;lt;` after two, and so on. Visible in Outlook / OWA / any HTML mail
client as literal `&` characters where the angle brackets should be.

**Cause**: `format_forward_header()` was returning recipient strings with
`&lt;` / `&gt;` already in place. The reply and forward callers
(`ReplyEmailTool`, `ForwardEmailTool`) then ran the same value through
`escape_html()` again, turning every `&` into `&amp;`. Each subsequent
reply quoted the previous body, so the entities compounded on every cycle.

**Fix**: `format_forward_header()` now returns plain text with literal `<`
and `>`. The single `escape_html()` at the call site is correct and produces
exactly one level of HTML entities. Regression coverage added in
`tests/test_reply_forward_escape.py`.

## Unreleased — Test-suite green-up (real bugs surfaced)

Local test suite was 18-failing on a fresh checkout. Triage found 16 test-side
issues (patch paths, fixture stubs, assertion drift after refactors) plus
**two real production bugs** that the failing tests had been quietly flagging:

- **`oof_settings(action="set", ...)` with an internal or external reply was
  unreachable**. The lazy import `from exchangelib import OofSettings, OofReply`
  raised `ImportError: cannot import name 'OofReply'` because exchangelib 5.x
  removed the wrapper class. `OofSettings.internal_reply` / `external_reply` are
  `MessageField(value_cls=str)` — they take plain strings. Switched the source
  to assign strings directly, dropping the dead `OofReply` wrapping.

- **`add_attachment(is_inline=True, ...)` silently dropped the Content-ID**.
  The schema didn't accept `content_id`, so callers couldn't reference inline
  images from HTML body via `cid:<id>`. Added the parameter; passes through to
  `FileAttachment(..., content_id=...)` and is echoed in the response.

Also: `attachment_tools.py` had redundant lazy `import base64` /
`from pathlib import Path` shadowing the module-level imports — removed; this
was breaking unit-test patches as a side effect.

## Unreleased — Tool reliability round (Issues 1–5)

Five defects reported against the live MCP deployment were fixed in this
round. Each has its own commit / branch so revert risk is surgical:

- **Issue 1** (`find_person` 30s timeout when `source=email_history`).
  The inbox scan now runs under an `asyncio.wait_for` deadline (default
  10s, configurable via `EWS_EMAIL_HISTORY_TIMEOUT` — clamped to
  `[1, 120]`). On timeout / auth / throttling the response carries a
  structured `error_code ∈ {TIMEOUT, THROTTLED, AUTH_EXPIRED, GAL_UNAVAILABLE}`
  so the caller can retry or degrade gracefully instead of hitting the
  30s MCP protocol timeout.

- **Issue 2** (`search_emails` silently truncated results). Paginated
  fetch now walks the underlying `QuerySet` in explicit 50-item chunks
  and narrows the `except Exception` at the iteration boundary so the
  real exception surfaces instead of being swallowed. `total_available`
  reports the server's `count()`; `next_offset` is set when there are
  more items behind the page. A new `.only(*db_fields)` projection skips
  fields the caller didn't ask for.

- **Issue 3** (`search_by_conversation` missed archive / subfolders).
  Default behaviour walks every mail folder under `account.msg_folder_root`
  (IPF.Note / IPF.Message classes only — calendar/contacts/tasks are
  skipped). Callers wanting the old behaviour pass
  `include_all_folders=false` + `search_scope=["inbox", ...]`. The
  response advertises `searched_folders` and `skipped_folders` with
  classified error codes so operators can tell what got missed.

- **Issue 4 — BREAKING CHANGE: legacy search envelope keys dropped.**
  The `search_emails` / `search_by_conversation` response envelope no
  longer emits `results`, `total`, `total_results`, or `total_count`.
  Callers must read `items` + `count` + `total_available` (and
  `next_offset` when the page is not the last). Migration: every
  response that used to ship `{"results": [...], "total": N}` now ships
  `{"items": [...], "count": N}`. `total_available` is populated on a
  best-effort basis from `QuerySet.count()`; absent when the server
  refuses to cheap-count.

- **Issue 5 — new tool `get_emails_bulk`.** Batch-fetches up to 50
  messages (hard cap 100) in a single `GetItem` round-trip via
  `exchangelib.Account.fetch([Message(id=x), ...])`. Per-id failures
  are surfaced in `errors[]` with `error_code="NOT_FOUND"` or
  `"FETCH_ERROR"`; whole-batch failures raise `ToolExecutionError`.

New shared observability helper `src/utils.py::ews_call_log(operation, ...)`
emits a structured `ews_call` log line on every EWS round-trip with
stable keys (`operation`, `duration_ms`, `result_count`, `total_available`,
`page_offset`, `folder`, `outcome`, `error_type`) so dashboards can build
SLOs on tool latency without parsing free-text log messages.

Regression coverage landed in `tests/test_find_person_timeout.py` (4),
`tests/test_search_emails_pagination.py` (6), `tests/test_search_by_conversation.py` (7),
and `tests/test_get_emails_bulk.py` (9). Existing tests that asserted on
the dropped legacy keys were migrated to `items` / `count` /
`total_available`.

## Previous — Bug 1 (find_meeting_times) + Bug 2 (embedding error surfacing)

Two operator-reported regressions from the v3.4 security/reliability release
are fixed here.

### Bug 1 — `find_meeting_times` returned 0 suggestions on a free calendar

`FindMeetingTimesTool.execute` read `busy_info.merged_free_busy`, but
exchangelib's `FreeBusyView` exposes the merged availability string as
`busy_info.merged` (the sibling tool `check_availability` was already
reading `.merged` correctly — fixed in commit `f33632c`). After the C3
fix that treats "missing merged data" as *busy*, this bug caused every
slot to be rejected even when the mailbox was entirely free.

**Fix:**

- New helper `_extract_merged(busy_info)` in `src/tools/calendar_tools.py`
  reads `.merged` first and falls back to the legacy `.merged_free_busy`
  attribute, so behaviour is correct whatever exchangelib decides to
  populate.
- `FindMeetingTimesTool` now uses the helper.
- A DEBUG-level diagnostic line logs `start_date`, `end_date`, `tzinfo`,
  `len(availability_data)`, and a sample of merged-string lengths when
  `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, so this class of bug is trivial to diagnose next
  time.

### Bug 2 — `semantic_search_emails` silently returned 0 hits on embedding failure

`OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.embed()` called `raise_for_status()` then
indexed into `response.json()["data"][0]`. Two failure modes slipped past
with generic error messages:

- A non-2xx response from Ollama/OpenAI's embeddings endpoint (e.g.
  `model "ollama" not found`) was wrapped in httpx's generic
  `HTTPStatusError` text without the upstream body.
- Some OpenAI-compat servers reply **HTTP 200 with an `{"error": ...}`
  body** — the index access then raised `KeyError`, bubbling up as
  "Failed to perform semantic search: 'data'".

**Fix (in order of defence-in-depth):**

1. **New `EmbeddingError` exception** (`src/exceptions.py`). Dedicated
   error type callers can catch to distinguish embedding failures from
   other tool errors.
2. **`OpenAIEmbeddingProvider._post_embeddings`** (new): centralises the
   HTTP call, pulls the upstream error message out of the body (handles
   `{"error": {"message": ...}}` and `{"error": "string"}`), wraps
   network failures with a clear message, and rejects 2xx responses with
   a top-level `error` field or a missing `data` array.
3. **`OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.health_check()`**: small probe method
   callers can use at startup (or first invocation) to convert "0 hits
   at query time" into a visible failure.
4. **`SemanticSearchEmailsTool.execute`**:
   - When the folder has no messages, return an explicit
     `success: true, result_count: 0, message: "No messages found in
     folder '...'"` — distinguishable from an embedding failure.
   - When `EmbeddingError` is raised, surface the upstream message plus
     an actionable hint:
     `Embedding provider error: <upstream> | Hint: Verify
     AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL matches an installed model at AI_BASE_URL (e.g.
     'text-embedding-3-small' for OpenAI, 'nomic-embed-text' for Ollama).`
5. **Config warning** (`src/config.py`): when
   `ENABLE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH=true` and `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` is set to a
   likely-provider-name (`ollama`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `cohere`,
   `voyage`, `local`), log a warning at startup so operators catch the
   typo before the first search call.
6. **Size cap**: `embed_batch` refuses more than 256 inputs per call to
   keep the process responsive; callers can iterate.

### Acceptance (matches the bug reporter's test plan)

Bug 1 — reproduction call against an all-free calendar now returns ≥ 5
suggestions (up to `max_suggestions`).

Bug 2 — with the wrong model, the repro call now returns:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Embedding provider error: Embedding provider returned HTTP 404 for model 'ollama': model \"ollama\" not found, try pulling it first | Hint: Verify AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL matches an installed model at AI_BASE_URL (e.g. 'text-embedding-3-small' for OpenAI, 'nomic-embed-text' for Ollama)."
}
```

With a correct model the call returns ranked results as before.

### Tests

`tests/test_bug_fixes.py` — 17 new tests:

- `_extract_merged` helper: picks the current attribute, falls back to
  legacy, returns None when absent.
- `find_meeting_times`: all-free, partial-busy, missing-merged,
  legacy-attribute paths.
- `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider`: 404 + error body surfaced, 200 +
  error-body surfaced, missing `data` rejected, mismatched batch size
  rejected, empty input short-circuits without network, connection
  errors wrapped, happy-path still returns a vector, provider-name
  warning on init.
- `SemanticSearchEmailsTool`: upstream error surfaced to operator with
  hint, empty folder returns explicit "No messages" message.

All 17 pass; full suite: 164 passing (was 147), 18 pre-existing failures
unchanged.

## Unreleased — Agent-secretary stack (memory, commitments, approvals, rules, briefings)

Adds a persistent, per-mailbox state layer and 24 new MCP tools that
turn the server from a stateless Exchange client into an **agentic
secretary**. See [`docs/AGENT_SECRETARY.md`](docs/AGENT_SECRETARY.md) for
the full guide.

### New infrastructure

- **`src/memory/`** — SQLite-backed, per-mailbox KV store with
  namespaces, TTL, size caps (1 MiB/value, 50 MiB/namespace), atomic
  read-delete (`consume`), and an audit table. Every mailbox gets its
  own file under `EWS_MEMORY_DIR` (default `data/memory/`) with a
  SHA-256-prefix filename — raw emails never touch the filesystem.
- **Typed repositories** — `CommitmentRepo`, `ApprovalRepo`, `RuleRepo`,
  `VoiceRepo`, `OOFPolicyRepo`. Each wraps the KV in a typed API and
  validates inputs.
- **BaseTool.get_memory_store()** — single helper every agent tool uses
  to reach the store for the authenticated primary mailbox.

### New MCP tools (24)

- **Memory** (4): `memory_set`, `memory_get`, `memory_list`, `memory_delete`
- **Commitments** (4): `track_commitment`, `list_commitments`,
  `resolve_commitment`, `extract_commitments` (AI-assisted)
- **Approval queue** (5): `submit_for_approval`,
  `list_pending_approvals`, `approve`, `reject`,
  `execute_approved_action` (atomic, single-use)
- **Voice profile** (2): `build_voice_profile` (samples Sent folder,
  AI-generates a style card), `get_voice_profile`
- **Rule engine** (5): `rule_create`, `rule_list`, `rule_delete`,
  `rule_simulate`, `evaluate_rules_on_message`. Match keys and action
  types are strict allow-lists.
- **OOF policy** (3): `configure_oof_policy`, `get_oof_policy`,
  `apply_oof_policy` (creates drafts, never sends)
- **Compound** (2): `generate_briefing` (inbox delta + meetings +
  commitments + overdue tasks + VIP activity), `prepare_meeting`
  (attendees + history + notes + attachment previews)

### `send_email` gains `dry_run`

`send_email(dry_run=true)` validates inputs, builds the Message object,
and returns a preview without calling `message.send()` or touching the
Drafts folder. Useful for "what would this send" pre-flight checks.

### New config flags

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ENABLE_AGENT` | `true` | Registers the 24 agent-secretary tools |
| `EWS_MEMORY_DIR` | `data/memory` | Jail for per-mailbox SQLite files |

### Tool count

- Base tools: 42 → **66** (24 new base tools under `ENABLE_AGENT=true`)
- Optional AI tools: 4 → 4 (unchanged)
- Grand total with everything on: **70**

### Security properties

- Per-mailbox file isolation by design (no shared tables between users)
- SQL placeholder-only queries
- Path jailing on the DB file directory
- Strict alphabet for namespaces and keys
- Value size caps + LRU pruning
- Atomic `consume` for single-use approval tokens
- Allow-lists for rule actions, match keys, and approval-queue actions
- AI prompts enforce PII-redaction instructions for the voice profile
- Forward rules only ever create drafts

### Test coverage

`tests/test_agent_secretary.py` — 23 new tests covering:
- Memory roundtrip, isolation, key/namespace validation, size caps,
  TTL expiry, list filtering, atomic consume, path jailing
- Commitment lifecycle, overdue filter, validation errors
- Approval submit/decide, action allow-list, double-consume refusal,
  TTL validation
- Rule action and match-key allow-lists, `fnmatch` semantics, AND
  combination across multiple match keys
- Voice and OOF repo roundtrips
- Reserved-namespace refusal from generic memory tools

All 23 pass; 18 pre-existing failures unchanged (147 passing total).

### Known follow-ups (intentionally deferred)

- Background watcher that fires `evaluate_rules_on_message` on
  inbound mail via `exchangelib` streaming notifications. Manual
  evaluation works today; the watcher is a separate infra change.
- Scheduled/recurring agent tasks (cron-style). Out of scope for this
  PR; plugs into the same memory layer when added.
- Memory-backed voice application inside `suggest_replies` /
  `create_reply_draft` prompts. The profile is stored and fetchable;
  wiring it into each draft prompt is a narrow follow-up.

## Unreleased — Security and reliability hardening

This release closes the 6 HIGH-severity findings from the end-to-end security
review and the top code-quality bugs found alongside them. **Behaviour
changes that operators need to know about** are called out under
"Breaking / operator-visible changes".

### Security fixes (HIGH)

- **S1 — Authenticated HTTP/SSE transport.** When `MCP_API_KEY` is set,
  every request to `/sse`, `/messages`, `/openapi.json`, and
  `/api/tools/{tool}` must present `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (or
  `X-API-Key`). Only `/health` remains public. The OpenAPI schema now
  advertises `bearerAuth` instead of the unenforced `basicAuth`.
- **S2 — TLS verification restored by default.** The EWS HTTP adapter
  no longer globally disables certificate verification. Set
  `EWS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true` to opt back in for internal Exchange
  servers with private CAs — a `WARNING` log line is emitted when used.
- **S3 — `download_attachment` path jail.** `save_path` is now treated
  as a basename hint only; directory components and `..` are stripped
  and the resolved path is verified to live inside `EWS_DOWNLOAD_DIR`
  (defaults to `./downloads`). This closes the pre-auth
  arbitrary-file-write → RCE chain with S1.
- **S4 — HTML injection in reply/forward drafts fixed.** `reply_email`,
  `forward_email`, `create_reply_draft`, and `create_forward_draft`
  now HTML-escape the original message's From/To/Cc/Subject/Sent
  fields and pass user-supplied bodies through a proper sanitiser
  (`utils.sanitize_html`, which now actually removes `<script>`,
  `<style>`, `on*=` handlers, and `javascript:` URIs). Plain-text
  bodies are escaped and newline→`<br/>` converted.
- **S5 — Audit log redaction.** `AuditLogger.log_operation` now runs
  every `details` payload through a new `redact_sensitive()` helper
  before writing to `audit.log`. Fields matching `password`, `token`,
  `secret`, `api_key`, `authorization`, `body`, `html_body`,
  `text_body`, `file_content`, `content_base64`, `mime_content`, or
  `inline_attachments` are replaced with `[redacted]` / length hints.
- **S6 — Default bind `127.0.0.1`.** `MCP_HOST` defaults to loopback;
  the SSE startup now refuses to bind a non-loopback address without
  `MCP_API_KEY`, and warns when running on loopback with no API key.

### Code-quality fixes (High)

- **C1** `read_attachment` now correctly extracts PDF / DOCX / XLSX.
  The `_read_pdf`, `_read_docx`, `_read_excel` methods were incorrectly
  placed on `AttachEmailToDraftTool` (they were unreachable from
  `ReadAttachmentTool.execute`, which silently fell back to a generic
  "Failed to read attachment" error for every non-TXT extraction).
- **C2** `main.py` now returns **JSON** over the MCP transport.
  Responses were built with `str(result)` (Python repr — single
  quotes, `True/False/None`, opaque `str(datetime(...))`).
- **C3** `find_meeting_times` fixes: slots outside the returned
  `merged_free_busy` range are now treated as **unavailable** (they
  were falsely reported as free), dead buffer-check code now actually
  runs, and accepted slots advance by `duration_minutes` so the tool
  stops emitting N overlapping 15-minute shifts of the same hour.
- **C4** `EmailService.get_message` and `ThreadService.get_thread` now
  use `account.trash` instead of the nonexistent `account.deleted`
  (which previously raised and was swallowed by a bare `except:`,
  silently skipping Deleted Items).
- **C5** OAuth2 credential path simplified. `AuthHandler` no longer
  pre-fetches an MSAL token that was then thrown away; `exchangelib`
  already handles the OAuth2 token lifecycle internally.
- **C6** Advanced search responses now stringify `ItemId` via
  `ews_id_to_str` so `message_id` is a plain string, matching the
  other search modes.

### Code-quality fixes (Medium)

- **C7** `RateLimiter`, `CircuitBreaker`, and `CacheAdapter` are now
  thread-safe; a `threading.Lock` guards every mutating critical
  section so concurrent tool executions don't race on the rate window,
  failure count, or cache dict.
- **C8** Inline-attachment `content_id` values are sanitized (spaces
  → dashes, non-ASCII stripped) and de-duplicated so multiple inlines
  with the same basename don't collide and so `cid:...` references
  render correctly in Outlook/OWA.
- **C9** `parse_datetime_tz_aware` / `parse_date_tz_aware` are now
  annotated `Optional[...]` to match their actual behaviour; bad
  inputs log a DEBUG line so silent None-assignment to exchangelib
  fields stops being invisible.
- **C10** `CreateReplyDraftTool` / `CreateForwardDraftTool` now use
  `add_reply_prefix` / `add_forward_prefix` so threads no longer stack
  "RE: RE: RE: …".
- **C11** Plain-text bodies in reply/forward/draft tools are HTML-escaped
  and newlines converted to `<br/>` (handled by the new
  `utils.format_body_for_html`).
- **C12** `ConnectionError` renamed to `EWSConnectionError` (alias
  kept for one release). The old name shadowed the Python builtin of
  the same name and broke `isinstance(e, ConnectionError)` matching
  for real OS-level socket errors.
- **C13** `GetCalendar` end-date heuristic no longer over-collects the
  day after when the caller explicitly asks for events ending at
  midnight; it now checks whether the input was date-only (no `T`).
- **C14** `EmbeddingService._save_cache` writes atomically
  (`tempfile` + `os.replace`) so a crash mid-write cannot corrupt
  `embeddings.json`.
- **C15** `EmbeddingService.embed_batch` no longer has an O(N²)
  `indices_to_embed.index(i)` lookup; replaced with positional
  iteration.
- **C16** `openapi_adapter.handle_rest_request` now returns a proper
  HTTP status (400 / 401 / 429 / 503 / 500) when a tool fails, matching
  the advertised OpenAPI responses.
- **C17** Tool-count comments corrected in `main.py` (42 base + 4 AI = 46).
- **C19** AI tools (`semantic_search_emails`, `classify_email`,
  `summarize_email`, `suggest_replies`) now accept `target_mailbox`
  for impersonation — they used to be the only four tools that
  ignored it.

### Code-quality fixes (Low)

- **C21** Remaining bare `except:` clauses in `attachment_service.py`
  replaced with logged `except Exception:` blocks.
- **C22** `run_server.py` no longer hardcodes `C:\Tools\ews-mcp`. It
  uses `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` so the MSIX
  wrapper works from any install location on any OS.
- **C25** Config now logs when `AI_MODEL` / `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
  defaults are applied (previously silent) and warns when semantic
  search is enabled against a local provider without
  `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` set.

### New settings

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MCP_API_KEY` | — | Bearer token required on every non-`/health` request on the SSE transport |
| `MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` (was `0.0.0.0`) | Bind address for SSE |
| `EWS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | `false` | Opt-in for internal Exchange with private CAs |
| `EWS_DOWNLOAD_DIR` | `downloads` | Jail directory for `download_attachment` writes |

### Breaking / operator-visible changes

- **SSE transport binds `127.0.0.1` by default.** Docker-compose files
  that expect the server on `0.0.0.0` must now set `MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0`
  **and** `MCP_API_KEY=<secret>` — startup refuses the combination
  without a key.
- **TLS is verified by default.** Setups that depended on the old
  behaviour must set `EWS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true` or install the
  internal CA bundle into the container's trust store.
- **`download_attachment` save path is jailed.** Callers can no
  longer pick an arbitrary filesystem location; only the basename of
  `save_path` is honoured and the file is written under
  `EWS_DOWNLOAD_DIR`. The response `file_path` shows the actual
  location.
- **MCP tool responses are now JSON** rather than Python repr.
  Clients that relied on parsing `True`/`False`/single-quoted dicts
  need to switch to `json.loads`.
- **`ConnectionError` → `EWSConnectionError`.** The old name is
  aliased for one release but should be replaced in any downstream
  `except` / `isinstance` checks.

## Prior to this release (also unreleased) — Drafts, folder discovery, availability fixes

### New Tools (+4)

Base tool count: **42** (38 → 42 with the additions below). Total with AI: **46**.

- `create_draft` — create an email draft in the Drafts folder without sending
- `create_reply_draft` — build a reply draft (quoted original, signature placeholder) for AI preview-before-send
- `create_forward_draft` — build a forward draft for AI preview-before-send
- `find_folder` — locate a folder by name or ID anywhere in the mailbox hierarchy

### New Features

- **HTML reply/forward drafts** (`src/tools/email_tools_draft.py`): preserve the original conversation, inline images, CDATA blocks, and Outlook-style quoted headers when composing a reply or forward.
- **Folder-ID support** on `move_email`, `copy_email`, and `manage_folder`: pass `destination_folder_id` / `parent_folder_id` to resolve by stable Exchange ID instead of display name or path.
- **Email MIME export** (`get_email_mime`): return the raw RFC-822 MIME of a message.
- **Attach email to draft** (`attach_email_to_draft`): attach another message as an `.eml` file to a draft.
- **Windows MSIX wrapper**: new entrypoint script corrects the Claude Desktop MSIX working-directory bug on Windows.

### Bug Fixes

- **Availability parsing** (`check_availability`): correctly parse exchangelib `merged_free_busy` responses.
- **Availability coverage**: include the current authenticated mailbox in availability checks by default.
- **Scheduling responses**: clarify free/busy output so the AI can act on the result without a second round-trip.
- **Reply / forward drafts**: fix threading metadata, signature placement, and duplicate `RE:` / `FW:` prefixes; preserve styles and CDATA in quoted HTML bodies.
- **Draft attachments**: attachment flow on drafts was failing in certain edge cases; fixed as part of the backlog-folder / availability / draft-attachment work.

### Documentation

- README fully refreshed: accurate tool counts (42 base + 4 AI = 46), full tool tables per category, complete environment-variable reference, corrected architecture diagram, new "Known limitations" section.
- New draft-workflow and folder-discovery examples.

### Known Limitations (unchanged from v3.4.0)

- The four AI tools (`semantic_search_emails`, `classify_email`, `summarize_email`, `suggest_replies`) do not honor `target_mailbox`; they always act on the primary authenticated mailbox.
- `read_attachment` extracts PDF / DOCX / XLSX only.
- The SSE/HTTP transport is unauthenticated and binds `0.0.0.0` by default — put it behind an auth-enforcing reverse proxy for any non-local deployment.

---

## v3.4.0 — Phase 3+4: Reliability & Code Quality (2026-03-15)

### New Features

#### Circuit Breaker (`src/middleware/circuit_breaker.py`)
- Trips after 3 consecutive EWS connectivity failures
- Rejects requests immediately for 60s instead of waiting for timeout
- Allows one probe request after timeout to test recovery
- Only trips on connectivity/timeout errors, not user errors (validation, not-found)
- Saves ~30s per request when Exchange is down (no more 3x10s timeout retries)

### Improvements

#### Simplified Error Messages
- `validate_input()` now produces `"to: Input should be a valid list"` instead of multi-line Pydantic internals
- `format_error_response()` returns `{"success": false, "error": "..."}` (removed redundant `error_type` field)
- Error messages truncated to 200 chars max — prevents Claude from processing paragraph-length Exchange error dumps
- `find_message_for_account()` returns `"Message not found: {id}"` instead of a 3-line suggestion paragraph

#### Proper async/await (`asyncio.to_thread`)
- All `resolve_names()` calls in GALAdapter wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` — no longer blocks event loop
- PersonService `_search_contacts()` and `_search_email_history()` run blocking iteration in thread pool
- Inbox + Sent scans in `_search_email_history` and `get_communication_history` now run concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`

### Code Quality

#### Removed Dead Code
- Removed `handle_ews_errors` decorator from `utils.py` (~70 lines) — was defined but never used by any tool
- All tools use `BaseTool.safe_execute()` for error handling instead

#### Deduplicated JSON Serialization
- `EWSJSONEncoder.default()` now delegates to `make_json_serializable()` instead of duplicating the same logic
- Single source of truth for datetime/EWS-object serialization

### Token Budget Impact
| Component | v3.3 | v3.4 | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Error responses | ~150 tokens | ~50 tokens | -67% |
| Circuit breaker (Exchange down) | ~5,000 tokens/min wasted | ~200 tokens/min | -96% |
| **Simple operation total** | ~6,700 | ~6,200 | **-7%** |

### Files Changed
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/middleware/circuit_breaker.py` | NEW (87 lines) |
| `src/middleware/__init__.py` | Added CircuitBreaker export |
| `src/tools/base.py` | Circuit breaker integration + simplified validation errors |
| `src/utils.py` | Removed handle_ews_errors, deduplicated JSON encoder, simplified error responses |
| `src/adapters/gal_adapter.py` | asyncio.to_thread for all resolve_names calls |
| `src/services/person_service.py` | asyncio.to_thread + asyncio.gather for blocking EWS operations |

---

## v3.3.0 — Phase 2: Tool Consolidation (2026-03-15)

### Breaking Changes
**10 tools removed** from the MCP surface. AI assistants will automatically adapt via `list_tools`. External automation calling these tools by name will need updating.

**Removed tools and their replacements:**

| Removed Tool | Replacement | How to Migrate |
|---|---|---|
| `advanced_search` | `search_emails` with `mode: "advanced"` | Add `mode: "advanced"` parameter |
| `full_text_search` | `search_emails` with `mode: "full_text"` | Add `mode: "full_text"`, rename `query` param |
| `search_contacts` | `find_person` with `source: "contacts"` | Use `find_person(query="...", source="contacts")` |
| `get_contacts` | `find_person` with `source: "contacts"` | Use `find_person(source="contacts")` (no query = list all) |
| `resolve_names` | `find_person` with `source: "gal"` | Use `find_person(query="...", source="gal")` |
| `create_folder` | `manage_folder` with `action: "create"` | Add `action: "create"` parameter |
| `delete_folder` | `manage_folder` with `action: "delete"` | Add `action: "delete"` parameter |
| `rename_folder` | `manage_folder` with `action: "rename"` | Add `action: "rename"` parameter |
| `move_folder` | `manage_folder` with `action: "move"` | Add `action: "move"`, use `destination` param |
| `get_oof_settings` | `oof_settings` with `action: "get"` | Use `oof_settings(action="get")` |
| `set_oof_settings` | `oof_settings` with `action: "set"` | Use `oof_settings(action="set", state="...")` |
| `get_communication_history` | `analyze_contacts` with `analysis_type: "communication_history"` | Add `analysis_type: "communication_history"` |
| `analyze_network` | `analyze_contacts` with `analysis_type: "overview"` etc. | Use `analyze_contacts(analysis_type="...")` |

### Tool Count (at v3.3 release)
- **Before:** 46 tools (42 base + 4 AI)
- **After v3.3:** 36 tools (32 base + 4 AI)
- **Reduction:** -10 tools

> **Note:** The base tool count has since grown back to 42 with the addition of `create_draft`, `create_reply_draft`, `create_forward_draft`, `find_folder`, `get_email_mime`, and `attach_email_to_draft` in later releases (see the Unreleased section at the top of this file).

### New Merged Tools

#### `search_emails` (unified search)
- `mode: "quick"` (default) — filter by subject, sender, date, read status, attachments
- `mode: "advanced"` — multi-folder search with sort, categories, importance, keywords
- `mode: "full_text"` — full-text search across subject, body, attachment names

#### `find_person` (unified contact lookup)
- `source: "all"` (default) — search GAL + contacts + email history
- `source: "gal"` — Active Directory only
- `source: "contacts"` — personal contacts only (no query = list all)
- `source: "email_history"` — email history only
- `source: "domain"` — domain-based search

#### `manage_folder` (unified folder management)
- `action: "create"` — create new folder
- `action: "delete"` — delete folder (soft or permanent)
- `action: "rename"` — rename folder
- `action: "move"` — move folder to new parent

#### `oof_settings` (unified OOF)
- `action: "get"` — retrieve current OOF settings
- `action: "set"` — configure OOF settings

#### `analyze_contacts` (unified contact analysis)
- `analysis_type: "communication_history"` — history with specific person (uses server-side sender filter)
- `analysis_type: "overview"` — comprehensive network overview
- `analysis_type: "top_contacts"` — most-emailed contacts
- `analysis_type: "by_domain"` — contacts grouped by domain
- `analysis_type: "dormant"` — inactive relationships
- `analysis_type: "vip"` — high-volume recent contacts

### Performance Improvements
- **Token savings:** ~2,200 tokens per `list_tools` call (10 fewer schemas × ~220 tokens each)
- **Wrong-tool retries eliminated:** Claude no longer picks wrong search/contact tool
- **Server-side filtering:** `analyze_contacts(analysis_type="communication_history")` uses `sender__email_address` server-side filter instead of scanning 2,000 items client-side
- **SearchByConversationTool:** `folder_map` moved outside loop (was recreated 3× per call)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed version string drift: `docker-compose-ghcr.yml`, `docker-entrypoint.sh` now show v3.3
- Fixed `SearchByConversationTool` creating `folder_map` inside loop

### Token Budget Impact
| Component | v3.2 | v3.3 | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool schemas (list_tools) | ~10,000 | ~4,500 | -55% |
| Tool selection retries | ~800 | ~200 | -75% |
| **Simple operation total** | ~18,000 | ~6,700 | **-63%** |

## v3.2.0 — Phase 1: Token Optimization & Bug Fixes (2026-03-14)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed autodiscovery ignoring `EWS_SERVER_URL` when `EWS_AUTODISCOVER=true`
- Fixed Docker container unable to reach corporate Exchange (switched to `network_mode: host`)
- Fixed single-day calendar queries returning wrong/missing events (zero-duration window)
- Fixed `format_datetime` not defined in `search_tools.py` (missing import)
- Fixed auth retry loop: `retry_if_not_exception_type(AuthenticationError)` skips retries on auth failures
- Fixed recursive folder search: subfolders + `root.walk()` fallback

### Optimizations
- Trimmed all 46 tool descriptions to 1 line (under 15 words)
- Removed dead `_search_email_history` from FindPersonTool (~140 lines)
- Replaced GAL fuzzy search 8-prefix loop with single query (1 API call instead of 8)
- Removed redundant recipient pre-validation from SendEmailTool (~40 lines, N API calls)
- Deduplicated `INLINE_ATTACHMENTS_SCHEMA` to single definition in `utils.py`
- Added server-side `sender__email_address` filter in PersonService

### New Features
- Base64 `inline_attachments` support on 5 tools (send_email, reply_email, forward_email, create_appointment, update_appointment)
- Person-centric architecture with multi-strategy GAL search (4 fallback strategies)
